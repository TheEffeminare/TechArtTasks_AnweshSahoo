This project represents my approach to building modular and artistically refined UI systems within Unity. I focused on creating solutions that balance technical precision with visual harmony - building systems that adapt seamlessly across devices, remain scalable for future updates, and feel polished to interact with. Developed in Unity 2022.3.31f1 (URP), the project includes three key parts: the Home Screen with a dynamic bottom bar, a reusable Settings Popup system, and a Level Completed screen designed to celebrate progression through responsive animation and subtle VFX. Each component was built with clarity in mind - from scripts like `PopupDriver` and `ResponsiveCanvasMatch` to layout logic using `SafeAreaFitter` and `ResponsiveBarPadding` - ensuring every layer of the UI works cohesively across form factors.

Beyond technical execution, this work reflects my design philosophy: that good technical art is about solving problems beautifully. Every decision, from the pace of a fade to the naming of a prefab, was made deliberately. The goal was not only to deliver functional results but to establish a foundation that can evolve - clean, efficient, and human in its craft. This test reaffirmed my love for bridging creativity with precision, for shaping systems that are as expressive for artists as they are reliable for engineers.
