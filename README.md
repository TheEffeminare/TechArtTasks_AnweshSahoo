This project represents the way I like to build things in Unity: modular, adaptable, and thoughtfully designed. My focus was on creating something that feels both technical and artistic, where the structure works as beautifully as it looks. Built in Unity 2022.3.31f1 (URP), this project includes three key parts: the Home Screen with a responsive bottom bar, a reusable Settings Popup system, and a Level Completed screen that brings everything together with movement and light. Each part was created to scale easily, to stay consistent across devices, and to feel polished from the inside out. From scripts like `PopupDriver` and `ResponsiveCanvasMatch` to layout tools such as `SafeAreaFitter` and `ResponsiveBarPadding`, every piece plays its role quietly and cleanly. :)

Beyond the technical side, this project captures what I truly enjoy about being a Technical Artist. For me, it’s never just about making something work, it’s about making it feel right. Every fade, interaction, and every small detail carries intention. I wanted to build a foundation that is clean, efficient, and full of heart. Working on this reminded me how much I love connecting creativity with precision, and how satisfying it is to shape systems that make art and technology speak the same language. Built with love, light, rainbow and a pocket full of hope. - Anwesh
